## Why R?

--

It's a programming language/software that is free and open source! `r emo::ji("celebrate")`

--

It was created by statisticians for statistics `r emo::ji("glasses")`

--

Because it's open source and works with scripts, it's great for reproducibility `r emo::ji("strong")`

--

Did I mention FREE?

---

## Ok... So why RStudio?

--

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE)

--

It's essentially a (much prettier) wrapper for the R software

--

R is integrated into RStudio, so you never actually have to open R
--
, which is a good thing...

## Basics of R

R is a language spoken by the R software

--

Software can be very 'dumb'

--

So we need to learn it's language to communicate EXACTLY
what we want

--

And like learning any language, this requires practice!

Things to look forward to:

```{r example-plot2, echo=FALSE}
interviews_plotting %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items, color = village)) +
   geom_count() +
   theme_minimal()
```


---

Things to look forward to:

```{r example-plot3, echo=FALSE}
percent_wall_type <- interviews_plotting %>%
    filter(respondent_wall_type != "cement") %>%
    count(village, respondent_wall_type) %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    mutate(percent = (n / sum(n)) * 100) %>%
    ungroup()

percent_wall_type %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = respondent_wall_type)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    theme_minimal() +
    scale_fill_viridis_d() # add colourblind-friendly palette
```

## Exercise 1

`r emo::ji("clock")` **5 mins**

Create two variables `r_length` and `r_width` and assign them values.

Create a third variable `r_area` and give it a value by multiplying `r_length`
and `r_width`.

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

--

### Solution

```{r}
r_length <- 6
r_width <- 7
r_area <- r_length * r_width
```

---
class: inverse

## Exercise 2

`r emo::ji("clock")` **5 mins**

Type `?round` into the **console** to open the help page for the `round()` function.

Find the appropriate function to round `1.624` down to the nearest integer.

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

--

### Solution

```{r}
floor(1.624)
```

---
class: inverse

## Exercise 3

`r emo::ji("clock")` **10 mins**

What will happen in each of the examples below?

`r emo::ji("bulb")` **Hint:** use `typeof()` to check the data type of your objects

```{r}
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
```

Why does this happen?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

---
class: inverse

### Solution

Vectors can only contain a single data type.

R converts to a common denominator that loses as little information
as possible.

character < double < integer < logical

```{r exercise-3-sol}
num_char
num_logical
char_logical
tricky
```

---
class: center, middle, inverse

## Exercise 4

`r emo::ji("clock")` **5 mins**

How many values in `combined_logical` are `"TRUE"` (as a string)?

```{r exercise-4}
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)
```

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

--

```{r exercise-4-sol}
combined_logical
```

--

The `TRUE` in `num_logical` gets converted to `1`, and then `"1"` when combined
with `char_logical`.

## Exercise 5

`r emo::ji("clock")` **10 mins**

1. Using this vector of rooms, create a new vector with the NAs removed:

```{r exercise-5}
rooms <- c(1, 2, 1, NA, 3, 1, 3, 2, 8, NA, 1)
```

2. then calculate the `median`.

3. Use R to calculate how many elements of `rooms` are larger than 2.

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

---
class: inverse

## Exercise 5

### Solution

```{r exercise-5-sol}
# 1
rooms_no_na <- rooms[!is.na(rooms)]
# or
rooms_no_na <- na.omit(rooms)

# 2
median(rooms, na.rm = TRUE) # or median(rooms_no_na)

# 3
rooms_above_2 <- rooms_no_na[rooms_no_na > 2]
length(rooms_above_2)
```
